# Learnify - My Learning Website

# What I Made

I created a simple online learning website called Learnify using HTML and CSS. 
It's a one-page site that shows courses, teachers, reviews and other stuff for students. 
The website looks nice with blue colors and cards everywhere.

# Main Parts of Website

- Top Header : Logo "Learnify", search box and Login/Signup buttons
- Big Intro Section : Welcome message and search form with gradient background
- Categories : 8 boxes with emojis like 💻 Development, 🎨 Design etc in grid
- Featured Courses : 4 course cards with images, stars rating, and prices
- Instructors : 4 teacher cards with photos and short descriptions
- Reviews : 2 student testimonials with their photos
- Articles : 3 article previews with read more links
- FAQs : 4 questions that look like buttons
- Newsletter : Email signup form
- Footer : Company info, links and social icons

# What I Did in HTML

-Used div containers everywhere for sections
